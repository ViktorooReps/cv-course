Tasks completed for a course on computer vision lectured on Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics
faculty of Moscow State University by Konushin Anton Sergeevich.  

If you happen to take this course at the moment or plan on doing it in the nearest future (what I
recommend you to do - the course is great) **do not look for solutions here** - you will ruin most of the
fun and value the course can give you.
